# matlab
Matlab code to find a inverse matrix of matrix named as A. 
It uses function "det" to determine if A is a singular matrix.
I've tried to get a 5x5 inverse matrix with it. But, there may be some unknown bugs. 
By the way, after getting the upper triangular matrix, we can also calculate the determinant value of A.
